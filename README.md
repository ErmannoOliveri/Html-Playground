# Html-Playground

Î‘ Simple to use single page html/css/js editor with live preview. 
Additionaly there are useful links from popular sites like W3school and GeeksForGeeks to help the user get started with the basics.





# Goals and Aims
In the end, i want to include a save/Download code button so that the user can locally save and use his code.
Also, the user will have the option to edit the "help" section by adding or removing links according to his needs.
